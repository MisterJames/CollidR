Getting it Running in Your Project
=======
Run the CollidR.Sample project (go to /person) to get a sense of what's going on. It's even better with two browsers running!

To get it going in your own project you'll need to
 * reference the CollidR DLL
 * copy CollidR.js into your scripts folder
 * reference the script from your edit page
 * create an instance of the CollidR proxy and register the client

You can see how this is done in the intro video above.

** I am preparing a NuGet package which will make most of this happen automatically for you. :) **
