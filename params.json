Check out the introduction on YouTube:  \r\n    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRGIUJaChyI\r\n\r\nGetting it Running in Your Project\r\n=======\r\nRun the CollidR.Sample project (go to /person) to get a sense of what's going on. It's even better with two browsers running!\r\n\r\nTo get it going in your own project you'll need to\r\n * reference the CollidR DLL\r\n * copy CollidR.js into your scripts folder\r\n * call RouteTable.Routes.MapHubs(); from Application_Start\r\n * reference the script from your edit page\r\n * create an instance of the CollidR proxy and register the client\r\n\r\nYou can see how this is done in the intro video above.\r\n\r\nA NuGet package helps put most of the above in place. Just drop into the Package Manager Console and type\r\n\r\n    install-package CollidR\r\n    \r\n...or check out the package on [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CollidR/).\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n=======\r\nFork away!
